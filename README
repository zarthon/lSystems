--- is a simple L-System Generator written in Python using PyOpenGL
It was made by Mohit Kothari(mohitrajkothari@gmail.com) and Viranch Mehta(viranch.mehta@gmail.com) for a 3rd Computer
Graphics course.

This was our fist hand try on OpenGL.

Requirements:
=============
-Python >2.5
-PyOpenGL (GLU, GLUT, GLE)

You can start by running (MAIN) file, on first run it will automatically read from "lsystems.txt" file and create the
L-System. The Syntax for file is as follows:-

Va;<list of all variables without seperation>
Ax;<Axiom of the System>
Ru;<Rule of system> 
####For each rule there one line is there#####
####Rule is defined as <variable>:<replacement>####
An;<Angle>
Si;<size> ###between 0 and 1####
