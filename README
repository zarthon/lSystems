lSystems
==========

lSystems is a simple L-System Generator written in Python using PyOpenGL
It was made by Mohit Kothari(mohitrajkothari@gmail.com) and Viranch Mehta(viranch.mehta@gmail.com) for a 3rd Computer
Graphics course.

This was our first hand try on OpenGL.

Requirements:
=============
-Python >2.5
-PyOpenGL (GLU, GLUT, GLE) 
-python2-numpy > 1.5

You can start by running main.py file, if you want to load an example system, you can do so by passing the name of the
system as an arguement to the main.py file while running it.

The system has been developed and tested in Linux environment so while running in winodws there might some glitches in
rendering speed and viewing

Example
=======

<python2 main.py koch_cubes>

Here is the list of available example systems:-

* gosper
* islands_lakes
* koch_moss
* peano
* sierpinski_median
* tetra_dragon
* hex_tile
* koch_cubes
* _lsystems (sample)
* pentigree
* quad_koch
* square_sierpinski


You can also create your own lsystem by defining certain parameters and saving as .txt file in example_systems.
L-System. The Syntax for file is as follows:-
####MEANS COMMENTS NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE .txt FILE
=====================================================

Va;<list of all variables without seperation>
Ax;<Axiom of the System>
Ru;<Rule of system> 
####For each rule there one line is there#####
####Rule is defined as <variable>:<replacement>####
An;<Angle>
Si;<size> ###between 0 and 1####
It;<iteration> ###number of iterations to be performed####
Sh;<shape>###choose from the list [square,line,circle,cube,cylinder]###    
========================================================================

There is also menu available which gives you several options, menu can be opened by right click.
You can move the system using arrow keys and rotate it using 'x' or 'X' or 'Y' or 'y'
Zoom feature is also available, to use it press 'z' or 'Z'
The Load File option in MENU will load 'lsystems.txt' from current directory. So you can also modify this file and use it.
